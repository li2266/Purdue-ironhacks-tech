Tested on Google Chrom

I want to customize my page to look similar to Zillow.com
I would like this to have a nice layout that is pleasing for the user.
I will also be implemening a GOOGLE MAP API that will locate where the grocery stores are.
I will also be implementing a scatter plot that compare all of the stores' prices & freshness

Keywords: Fresh, grocery, API, HTML, CSS, Javascript, data, analysis, web, freshness, price
