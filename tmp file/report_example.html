				<td colspan="4">Thanks for submitting your app! We really enjoyed evaluating you application. The feedback below should help you to improve your application! It will not influence the score of your final solution, so don't worry!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td colspan="4">We judge your application in four dimensions: Technology, User requirements, InfoVis and Novelty. You find your results below. The better you score on each of these dimensions, the higher your changes of winning. </td>

				<th rowspan="2">Technology</th>
				<td rowspan="2">We evaluate your app in terms of (1) technical errors and the successful achievement of technology requirements. 
(1) Error rating: We differentiate three types of errors: Major errors that prevent the application from working properly, moderate errors that impede the application from being fully functional, and minor errors that are rather 'cosmetic'. We present a total error rating, in which we weight major errors with 3, moderate errors with 2, and minor errors with 1. The lower the error rating the worse your performance (the more errors are in your application). 
(2) Tech requirements: You are expected to meet all 9 technological requirements specified in the challenge description (www.ironhacks.com). All requirements are equally weighted. </td>

				<th>InfoVis</th>
				<td>In the dimension of infovis our team of info vis experts focuses on three core aspects of information visualization usability: System affordance: Does the application offer recognizable elements and interactions that can be understood by the user? Cognitive workload: Is the number of alternatives from which the user can choose appropriate? Would a potential user have to memorize a lot of information to carry the task? You can achieve a score from 0 to 100. All trhee dimensions are equally weighted. </td>

				<th rowspan="2">Novelty</th>
				<td rowspan="2">Adding new data sets definitely makes your app standing out from the rest. We evaluate how successfully you implement those open data: How relevant are those open datasets?  How well was the implementation executed in the app?  For the implication score you can achieve a score from 0 to 100. We evaluate each datasets individually and then average score across all datasets that you use. </td>
